# Tasks to transform app into groceries and cosmetics selling app

- [ ] Create src/components/ProductItem.jsx: Component to display individual product details and "Add to Cart" button
- [ ] Create src/components/ProductList.jsx: Component to display list of products with category filtering (groceries, cosmetics)
- [ ] Create src/components/Cart.jsx: Optional cart component to show selected items and total price
- [ ] Create src/data/products.js: Sample hardcoded product data array with groceries and cosmetics items
- [ ] Update src/App.js to:
    - Replace TextToSpeech import and usage with new components
    - Manage app state for selected products and cart
    - Provide category browsing UI
- [ ] Add basic styling to src/App.css or src/styles.css for product listing layout

Followup after initial implementation:
- Test the app UI and functionality
- Refine styling as needed
